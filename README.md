### 🧠 About Me

I'm a final-year Computer Software Engineering student at **Belgium Campus**, currently immersed in the development of intelligent systems and efficient user-facing web applications. My primary focus lies in building **LLM chains** and tooling using **Python**, optimized for local hardware, as well as creating modular and scalable front and back end architectures with modern JavaScript frameworks.

With a strong foundation in **systems thinking**, I approach software with a balance of design aesthetics, practical performance, and long-term maintainability.

I’m especially passionate about:
- Intuitive front-end user experiences and UI/UX principles
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and local AI tooling
- Systems-level programming and architectural design
- Writing clean, extensible, and well-documented code
- Exploring how software, data, and infrastructure interact at scale
